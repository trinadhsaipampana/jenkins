If any user forgot their password, we can reset the password of that user by executing the following steps

Connect to jenkins server and edit the /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml file as follows:

<useSecurity>true</useSecurity> to <useSecurity>false</useSecurity>

After editing save the file and restart the jenkins:

sudo systemctl restart jenkins

Now go to the jenkins GUI and follow the following steps:

Navigate to Manage Jenkins-System Security.

Here change the Authentication from "None" to "Jenkins own user database" and save it.

Navigate to Manage Jenkins-Users.

Here select that user for whom we want to reset password and then change the password.
